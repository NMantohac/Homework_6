Description:
  - A weather dashboard that searches up a city name and displays the current weather for that city, along with the a 5-day forecast.
    The information displayed includes the current date, temperature (fahrenheit), humidity, wind-speed, weather-image, and UV-index.
    In addition, the searched cities are saved and could be accessed again unless the 'Clear History' button is clicked or the page is
    refreshed.
  - The weather dashboard and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes
    Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices, whereas the javascript file contains
    variables (const/let), functions, onclick events, for-loops, and if-else statements. In addition, npm initialization and
    installation was used in order to install Axios for the API request calls, and Moment.js for the current dates. 
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery
  - Bootstrap
  - npm - Axios
  - npm - Moment.js
  
  Challenges:
  - This was similar in difficulty compared to the last homework, but the main difference is that I decided to use vanilla Javascript,
    since we're using Node.js, which utilizes it. Also because I thought it'd be best to switch it up, so I don't completely rely on
    jQuery all the time. Overall, it wasn't a very difficult homework, since AJAX requests should be relatively easy for me now due
    to experience with Project 1.
  - There were a few difficulties such as the local storage and the color change for the UV-Index. I had to search up and use my online
    resources, so I could understand how to correctly implement and display them on the page. 
  - Not much that I learned other than the stuff regarding this homework, such as the Open Weather API documentation (if I would need
    to use it in the future) and the utilization of axios/moment.js
  - I was able to solve each of my problem through persistent effort, patience, and using my online resources!
